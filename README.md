The feeling of looking up to " MIT " never fades away, I love reading its history, research, dedication and the MIT culture. But Let's focus on CS and AI @ MIT from a public view in this blog post. For a virtual tour - [MIT Virtual Tour](http://web.mit.edu/vrtour/), [MIT bloggers](https://www.youtube.com/user/MITbloggers/videos), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cpsphotolibrary/), [Youtube 1](https://youtu.be/u0SFyokPoBk), [Youtube 2](https://youtu.be/nv277w2yBWI), [A Day in the Life: MIT](https://youtu.be/ZMyKOkyAjUQ), [Youtube 3](https://youtu.be/QlP4X_qQGTw), [MIT](https://youtu.be/MN_uGfDtRHo), [Video Tour : MIT](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/follow-me-a-video-tour-of-campus) etc. Make sure to have a Google Earth 3D tour, especially Strata centre [Home of CSAIL] after you have gone through the MIT map from [here](https://github.com/SKKSaikia/MIT4AI/blob/master/images/main/9cfc5135ffedd3c387293a8e6f54d814.png). For MIT classes, lectures and notes, we have [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm). Also, there's plenty of fun stuff at MIT [Battlecode](https://www.battlecode.org/#/), [Hack MIT](https://hackmit.org/), [MIT Integration Bee](http://www.mit.edu/~same/integrationbee.html), [MIT Robotics](https://robotics.mit.edu/). etc , make sure to check them out. Also follow the Profs and Researchers from MIT, all of them are making impact in the world in some way or other. I have been following some of them -  [Daniela Rus](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/daniela-rus), [Eric Demaine](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/erik-demaine), and more to explore :)

Now Let's get started with <h1><b>CS @ MIT</b></h1>

<img src="https://github.com/SKKSaikia/MIT4AI/blob/master/images/main/MIT_CSAIL.jpg">

Welcome Home, I guess ! MIT CS [[EECS]](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/)  is huge, but we will focus only on [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/). It will not be easy to digest everything, but focus and make sure to understand and go through everthing I list here. This blog is personal as well as public, so everything I list here, I personally kind of understand them word by word, helps me get a grisp of the content. Hope you enjoy! " Mens et Manus"

Research Areas @ [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research)

I will focus this blog on three areas:

⌘ AI & Machine Learning

⌘ Security & Cryptography

⌘ Systems & Networking
